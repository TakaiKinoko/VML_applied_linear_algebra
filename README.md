# VML_applied_linear_algebra
Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares exercises by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe

### About the textbook
The best thing about this book is all the application examples associated with each block of knowledge, which wasn't part of my previous study of linear algebra. 
I didn't include the examples in the README notes(see below) though.

### In each chapter folder:
* My notes on the textbook are stored in README.md 
* My notes on the julia-lang-companion are stored in JULIA.md
