#### 1.1  -- not sure!!
* (a) true -- square brackets and brackets are interchangeble in the mathematical notation of vectors 
* (b) true 
* (c) bad notation -- 
    If (_ ,_ ,_) is acceptable as representation of stack vectors then the two are stacked differently. 
    Else they could represent different tuples or arrays altogether. 

#### 1.2
* (a) -- correct -- 10-vector
* (b) -- correct -- 31-vector
* (c) -- incorrect, adding a 10-vector to a 20-vector
* (d) -- correct -- 11-vector
* (e) -- correct -- 30-vector
* (f) -- incorrect -- adding a 10x2 matrix to a 20x1 matrix
* (g) -- correct -- 20-vector

#### 1.3 -- not sure!!
* (a) -- correct, unambiguous -- 0's length can be inferred from the context
* (b) -- incorrect -- (0, b) exceeds the length of a
* (c) -- correct? but ambiguous -- can't infer the what the lengths of 0 vectors are respectively
* (d) -- incorrect -- 0 is overloaded within the same expression
