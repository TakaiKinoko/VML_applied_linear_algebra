* (a) true -- square brackets and brackets are interchangeble in the mathematical notation of vectors 
* (b) true 
* (c) bad notation -- 
    If (_ ,_ ,_) is acceptable as representation of stack vectors then the two are stacked differently. 
    Else they could represent different tuples or arrays altogether. 

#### 1.2
* (a) -- correct -- 10-vector
* (b) -- correct -- 31-vector
* (c) -- incorrect, adding a 10-vector to a 20-vector
* (d) -- correct -- 11-vector
* (e) -- correct -- 30-vector
* (f) -- incorrect -- adding a 10x2 matrix to a 20x1 matrix
* (g) -- correct -- 20-vector
